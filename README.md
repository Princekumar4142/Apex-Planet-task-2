Task 2: Responsive Contact Form & To-Do List

This repository contains the source code for my second internship task at ApexPlanet Software Pvt. Ltd. The project is a responsive web application featuring a contact form and a dynamic to-do list, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Project Features:**

**1. Contact Panel:**
- A user-friendly contact form with fields for name, email, and message.
- Client-side validation to ensure proper data input.
- A success message that appears after a valid submission.

**2. To-Do List Panel:**
- Functionality to add new tasks to a list.
- The ability to delete tasks once they're completed.
- A real-time counter that tracks the number of active tasks.

This project was a great opportunity to apply more advanced JavaScript concepts and build a multi-functional web application from the ground up.

**Technologies Used:**
- HTML5
- CSS3 (with responsive design principles)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
